```{r TASK}
# Use the hotels-europe dataset and pick a city. Use hotel user rating to create a binary variable: highly_rated=1 if rating â‰¥ 4, 0 otherwise. Examine how high rating is related to the other hotel features in the data. 
# 
# Estimate linear probability, logit, and probit models with distance and stars as explanatory variables. You may add other variables if you wish. 
# Compare coefficients, marginal differences, and predicted probabilities, and discuss your results. 
# 
# This is an assignment that you may do alone or in a pair within your group. You shall write a short (max 1 page, excluding exhibits) report that describes your major decisions, your estimated models, interpretations and summary. You may have a descriptive data table (optional), a regression table and up to two graphs. All codes should be pushed to your version control repo, with appropriate commit policy.
# You need upload your report in pdf format. Add the link of your repo to the online text field.
